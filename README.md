About
This repo groups concise, actionable patterns and references for backend engineers, architects, and SREs. It covers system design, distributed systems, data engineering, performance tuning, and operational practices. Each item links to quality papers, blog posts, talks, or open-source projects. The goal: help you design systems that scale, behave well under load, and recover from failure.

What you will find
- Patterns explained with intent, problem, solution, and trade-offs.
- Practical recipes and command examples.
- Architecture diagrams and mental models.
- Reading lists: seminal papers, books, and blog posts.
- Tooling: observability, orchestration, messaging, storage.
- Interview questions and design exercises.

Core architecture patterns
- Load Balancing â€” Distribute traffic across nodes to avoid hotspots. Use health checks and sticky sessions only when required.
- Caching â€” Reduce latency and load with multi-layer caches: CDN, edge cache, application cache, and local cache.
- Sharding â€” Partition data horizontally to scale write throughput and storage. Design key schemes for even distribution.
- Replication â€” Use leader-follower or multi-leader models for availability and read scaling. Decide on sync vs async replication by consistency needs.
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) â€” Separate read and write models to optimize each path.
- Event Sourcing â€” Store state transitions as an append-only log. Use for auditability and rebuildable views.
- Service Mesh â€” Offload networking concerns like mTLS, retries, and telemetry to a sidecar layer.
- API Gateway â€” Centralize client-facing policies: auth, rate limiting, and protocol translation.
- Bulkhead â€” Isolate resources so failures donâ€™t cascade.
- Circuit Breaker â€” Fail fast when a downstream system is unhealthy. Combine with fallback strategies.

Data and storage patterns
- Event Streams â€” Use Kafka or Pulsar for high-throughput, ordered streams and replayability.
- Log-structured Storage â€” Optimize for writes and compaction; use LSM trees for high write rates.
- Time-series Storage â€” Use retention, downsampling, and indexing to handle high write rates and queries.
- Indexing and Search â€” Use inverted indexes and sharded search clusters for full-text and analytical queries.
- Materialized Views â€” Precompute views to speed reads; manage invalidation via events.
- Consistent Hashing â€” Rebalance nodes without mass data reshuffle.
- Secondary Indexes â€” Trade write cost for read speed; consider asynchronous index updates.

Resilience and ops patterns
- Backpressure â€” Apply flow control when a component cannot keep up. Use bounded queues, rate limiting, or windowing.
- Retry with Idempotency â€” Retry transient failures while ensuring operations remain idempotent.
- Graceful Shutdown â€” Drain connections and finish in-flight operations before stopping.
- Canary Releases and Blue/Green â€” Deploy changes to a subset of traffic, measure results, then promote.
- Auto-scaling â€” Scale based on relevant signals: request latency, queue length, or custom metrics.
- Observability â€” Collect logs, traces, and metrics. Correlate with distributed tracing.
- Chaos Engineering â€” Inject failures to discover brittle assumptions.
- Capacity Planning â€” Model peak load, tail latencies, and growth to plan capacity and budget.

Design guides and trade-offs
- Consistency vs Availability vs Partition tolerance (CAP) â€” Choose the trade-off that fits your use case.
- Latency vs Throughput â€” Tune batching, concurrency, and resource limits to balance one against the other.
- Synchronous vs Asynchronous â€” Sync simplifies reasoning; async improves throughput and resilience.
- Monolith vs Microservices â€” Choose modularity, deployment complexity, and operational cost deliberately.
- Data locality â€” Bring compute to data for heavy analytical workloads.

Hands-on labs and examples
- Scalable HTTP API with Nginx, Node, and Redis cache (example app and load script).
- Event-driven pipeline using Kafka + Flink for stream processing.
- Distributed job queue with visibility timeout and retries (Redis/Sidekiq pattern).
- Sharded storage demo with consistent hashing and node join/leave simulation.
- Observability lab with Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger tracing.

Each lab includes a minimal repo, docker-compose files, and a small test harness. See the labs folder for code samples, scripts, and diagrams.

Interview practice
- System design prompts
  - Design a global feed system for 100M users with 10K writes/sec.
  - Design a rate-limited API gateway for third-party clients.
  - Design a distributed file store with low tail latency.
- Key topics to master
  - Distributed consensus (Raft, Paxos)
  - Quorum systems and replication factors
  - CAP and PACELC trade-offs
  - Partitioning, rebalancing, and compaction
  - Observability patterns and SLOs
- Sample answers and diagrams included for each prompt.
